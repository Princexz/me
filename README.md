### About Me

I am a Software Developer focused on building high-quality, thoughtful, and intuitive websites and web applications. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a Full-stack Software development program remotely and studying through pair-programming with amazing folks all around the world at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)

As a software Engineer student at [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/), I've had the opportunity to work along-side professionals in notable projects. I value the ideas of hard-work and persistence. These values have aided my career as a developer and have shaped me into the person I am today.

I like to spend my free time adding on to my web stack and chasing my dream of becoming a full-time software engineer. Other than coding.
